Hey! I'm Nicklas Kenyon Mooers (né Kenyon). 

I'm a happy husband, software engineer, game dev, multimedia artist, and musician.

My dream is to provide people the same happiness, passion, and community that I have had thanks to video games, TV shows, and movies (emphasis on video games).

In my free time I'm developing my own games and making gaming content with my wife, Nicole, under the name [RadiantGardeners](https:///www.radiantgardeners.com). I'm also working on an app that will make it way easier for non-technical streamers to build more unique, rich experiences for their Twitch streams.

I'm currently trying to get better at leatherworking and learning how to play the ocarina I bought at a renn faire. 

My 2023 (and 2024) resolution was to learn Japanese and I have been loving it! 
> 私はニックです。 はじめまして!

To know more about where I started and what my journey has been, I invite you to read more of [My Story](/my-story/).
