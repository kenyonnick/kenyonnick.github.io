I'm Nicklas. Most people call me Nick. Online, people might call me `radiantnick`.

I'm a happy husband, software engineer, game dev, content creator, multimedia artist, and musician.

My dream is to provide people the same happiness, passion, and community that I have had thanks to video games, TV shows, and movies (emphasis on video games).

In my free time I'm developing my own games over at [RadGard Studios](https://www.radgardstudios.com) and making gaming content with my wife, Nicole, under the name [RadiantGardeners](https:///www.radiantgardeners.com).

Since 2023 I've slowly been learning Japanese and I have been loving it!
