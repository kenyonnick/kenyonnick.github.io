I had the pleasure of working on the game as a Game Programmer Intern during the summer of 2017.

On the tech rider for the game I am credited for:
- Programming
- Animation
- Rigging
- VFX

My responsibilities included programming AI/NPC behaviors on the battlefield (pathing, state machine, morale system), logic and procedural 
animation for character respawning, and iterating other small mechanics.
I also modeled some primitive level assets (rocks, trees, bunkers), rigged and animated the NPC soldiers, and did some level design of the battlefield.
