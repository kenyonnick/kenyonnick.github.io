Cube Emitter was a simple foray into visual effects and CGI on an inspired weekend. I grew up loving film and wanting to make movies, and in particular loved watching behind the scenes bonus content to see how things were made.

With this project, I just wanted to get something simple to work, and there isn't much that's simpler than a 3D cube and tracking my watch band to get a cool little animation going. The goal was to make it look like I summoned the cube and had control over it.

If I remember correctly, I made this with Adobe After Effects, Maya, and whatever phone I had at the time.

Additional notes: 
- I loved that shirt, but I no longer have it :(
- My posture and my hair have both improved since this was made
