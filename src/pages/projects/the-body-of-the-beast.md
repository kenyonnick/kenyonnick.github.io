Below is a PDF of the first five pages of the game book. These pages include the title page, table of contents, and introduction. The game was designed over the course of a semester for a class on RPG Game Design. The final requirement for the course was to publish the game through Amazon's CreateSpace service. If you want to purchase the game, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Body-Beast-Game-Internal-Conflict-ebook/dp/B01EYRHFCU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1478124477&sr=8-1&keywords=the+body+of+the+beast+a+game+of+internal+conflict">buy it on Amazon</a>.

This game was developed as part of a RPG Game Design class taught by Brenda Romero at Clarkson University. Over the course of a semester, I worked with my teammates Emma Atkinson, Yoel Ben-Avraham, and Michael Fulton to design a full table-top RPG inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.

I had a ton of fun working on this game from writing lore, to building spreadsheets of all of the weapons, armor, and items you could get in the game.
