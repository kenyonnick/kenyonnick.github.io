Data Range is an award-winning virtual reality arcade shooter made in 24 hours for [Hack Potsdam]<a href="http://www.hackpotsdam.com">Hack Potsdam</a>. The game won first place, and our talented team of five won the grand prize! Working on this game for Hack Potsdam was an amazing experience. Our team quickly put together a pipeline for working on multiple aspects of the game so that asset development and programming were being done at the same time. Everyone worked well together to remain productive and help each other where and when it was needed.
