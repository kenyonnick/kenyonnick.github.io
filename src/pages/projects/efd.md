The latest build of the game is available on [Itch.io](https://kenyonn.itch.io/dimension)

Dimension a 3D platforming puzzle game I spent two years working on. The game gives players the ability to change gravity to change their perspective on their environment and influence the world around them. The game is three levels where players must collect key cards to progress through doors and answer a personal question correctly. These questions and preset answers are meant to challenge ideas of identity, labels, and how much control we have over them, juxtaposed with the player's control over their perspective.

This was a game I developed independently in the last 2 years of college that I worked on outside of classes, sought out 2 independent studies for, and integrated into my Digital & Arts Sciences CAPSTONE project and Honors Program thesis.

Outside of a couple of 3D assets, I modeled, rigged, animated, designed, and programmed everything in the game. I'm exceptionally proud of what I accomplished with this game.
