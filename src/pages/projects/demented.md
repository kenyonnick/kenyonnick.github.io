Demented is a text-based puzzle game that I made in 2 hours when I probably should have been sleeping. The game itself is a proof-of-concept for a mechanic that I had been thinking of incorporating into *Dimension*. It is an experiment in user-frustration, how people interact with game elements and the unknown, how preconceptions and cultural/sociological training impacts our perception of information, and user memory and pattern recognition. It's a lot of fun to watch people play, and I learn something every time I get to see someone experience it.
