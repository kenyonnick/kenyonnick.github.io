I don't remember when I wrote this poem or why anymore, but it ended up working well for my final project in my 3D modeling and animation course in college.

I textured and animated the entire project. All of the models were made by me except for the human mesh, which was provided to me with rigging by my professor, [Alex Lee](https://alexmlee.com/).

I leveraged Maya's Python scripting capabilities to automate the animation of the field of geometric fragments. 

Audio production was done by me in FL Studio.

The poem:
> He walked across a bridge of glass<br/>
> And as he did it shattered.<br/>
> Around him fell a broken past<br/>
> And with it that which mattered.
> 
> But as he looked ahead he saw<br/>
> The bridge was made of clay.<br/>
> Smooth and rough and wet and raw,<br/>
> To shape it as he may.
> 
> As he walked the sun came up,<br/>
> And on him it would focus.<br/>
> Drying only where he was<br/>
> But not the path ahead.
> 
> When he was sad and thought, "alas",<br/>
> Then the sun would wane.<br/>
> With it went the clay to glass<br/>
> To shatter and fall again.
> 
> On this bridge he came to learn<br/>
> That onwards was the clay<br/>
> Where the things he still came to yearn<br/>
> Could be molded throughout the day.
