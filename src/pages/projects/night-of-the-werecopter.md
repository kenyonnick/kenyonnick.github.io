Made in 12 hours for a game jam at Clarkson with my buddy Yoel Ben-Avraham. I used Java's AWT library to create my own very simple game engine from scratch. Yoel came up with the game concept and made the artwork while I built out the level design, physics, character controller, animations, and NPCs. The challenge of making it in such a short amount of time was very fun!

Unfortunately the JAR I have for the game doesn't run anymore and my code was lost on a corrupted hard drive.
