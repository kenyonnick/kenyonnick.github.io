Made with Yoel Ben-Avraham.

Add download of the JAR or maybe upload to Itch.io?

## Development

I wrote all of the code for the game in 12 hours for a game jam at Clarkson. I used Java's AWT library to create my own very-simple game engine. The challenge of making it in such a short amount of time was very fun!
